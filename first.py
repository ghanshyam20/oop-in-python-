# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

# OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects and classes.
# A class is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances containing data (attributes) and functions (methods).
# OOP helps in structuring complex programs, promoting code reuse, and making code easier to maintain.
# Key concepts in OOP include:
# - Class: Defines the structure and behavior of objects.
# - Object: An instance of a class.
# - Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
# - Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to some of an object's components.
# - Polymorphism: Allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.

# Example:
# class Animal:
#     def speak(self):
#         print("Animal speaks")

# class Dog(Animal):
#     def speak(self):
#         print("Dog barks")

# dog = Dog()
# dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks



# Fake convo (Backend Dev & DevOps Engineer) - key points

# Backend: "Seeing 500 errors. Is API server OK?"
